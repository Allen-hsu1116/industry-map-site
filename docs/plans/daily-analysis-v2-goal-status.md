# Daily Analysis V2 Goal Status Ledger

Updated: 2026-06-11 23:52 CST

## Purpose

Persistent record of which Daily Industry Intelligence goal slices have been implemented, verified, and what remains. This file exists because conversation summaries and uncommitted diffs are not a durable enough source of truth for multi-session goal work.

## Status semantics

- **Done:** Acceptance is implemented and verified for the goal/task as currently scoped.
- **Partial:** A verified vertical slice exists, but the full goal wording still has remaining sections or polish.
- **Not started:** No verified implementation slice yet.
- **Blocked/Needs decision:** Requires product or source-of-truth decision before implementation.

## Goal status

### Goal 1 — Contracts foundation

**Status:** Partial; contracts checkpointed in git, final full-goal review still remains.

**Evidence in code/tests:**
- `src/lib/dailyAnalysisV2.ts`
- `src/lib/dailyAnalysisV2.test.ts`
- `src/lib/researchSignals.ts`
- `src/lib/researchSignals.test.ts`
- `src/lib/stockKnowledgeRules.contract.test.ts`
- `src/lib/productNavigation.ts`
- `src/lib/productNavigation.test.ts`

**Checkpoint commit:**
- `aa6b11e feat: add daily analysis v2 contracts`

**Verification:**
- Focused contract tests passed during checkpointing.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing after all checkpoint commits.
- `npm run build` → passing after all checkpoint commits.

**Remaining:**
- Confirm all contract docs/spec references are synchronized.
- Keep future scoring/gating threshold changes spec-first.

### Goal 2 — Context adapters

**Status:** Partial; context adapters checkpointed in git, final source-semantics review still remains.

**Evidence in code/tests:**
- `src/lib/companyAnalysisContext.ts`
- `src/lib/companyAnalysisContext.test.ts`
- `src/lib/topicAnalysisContext.ts`
- `src/lib/topicAnalysisContext.test.ts`
- `src/lib/industryChainMap.ts`
- `src/lib/industryChainMap.test.ts`

**Checkpoint commit:**
- `91ed21a feat: add daily analysis context adapters`

**Verification:**
- Focused adapter tests passed during checkpointing.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing after all checkpoint commits.
- `npm run build` → passing after all checkpoint commits.

**Remaining:**
- Confirm adapters cover the final intended source semantics.
- Continue moving page-local data shaping toward reusable view models.

### Goal 3 — Grade gating

**Status:** Partial; grade-gating contract checkpointed in git, threshold governance remains.

**Evidence in code/tests:**
- `src/lib/dailyAnalysisV2.ts`
- `src/lib/dailyAnalysisV2.test.ts`
- Daily report gating tests in existing report-related test files.

**Checkpoint commit:**
- `aa6b11e feat: add daily analysis v2 contracts`

**Known guardrail:** D/F grades must never render as recommendations.

**Verification:**
- Focused gating tests passed during checkpointing.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing after all checkpoint commits.
- `npm run build` → passing after all checkpoint commits.

**Remaining:**
- Keep threshold changes gated by spec updates.
- Keep D/F visibility as observation-only, never recommendation copy.

### Goal 4 — Daily V2 artifacts

**Status:** Partial; V2 artifact generator checkpointed in git, UI/automation integration still incomplete.

**Evidence in code/tests:**
- `src/lib/dailyAnalysisV2Generator.ts`
- `src/lib/dailyAnalysisV2Generator.test.ts`
- `scripts/generate-daily-analysis-v2.ts`
- `package.json` script changes.

**Checkpoint commit:**
- `a5ecb94 feat: add daily analysis v2 generator`

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "DailyAnalysisV2 generator|DailyAnalysisV2 dry-run artifact command"` → 149/149 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing after all checkpoint commits.
- `npm run build` → passing after all checkpoint commits.

**Remaining:**
- Daily Report V2 view-model integration is not fully extracted.
- Company Detail still mainly consumes v1 `/data/analysis/{code}.json` daily analysis artifact.
- V2 refresh integration belongs to Goal 9.

### Goal 5 — Daily Focus UI

**Status:** Partial; verified vertical slices complete, full extraction/polish remains.

**Implemented slices:**
- Human Editorial Daily Report hero/market thesis.
- Today story derived from checked-in daily report/event data.
- Daily focus topic/company links.
- Candidate decision brief before dense evidence modules.

**Evidence in code/tests:**
- `src/app/daily-report/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/dailyFocusUi.test.ts`

**Checkpoint commit:**
- `eba4a7e feat: add daily focus editorial UI`

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "Daily Focus"` → 149/149 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing after all checkpoint commits.
- `npm run build` → passing after all checkpoint commits.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/daily-report` → editorial hero, decision brief, topic links, company links, and stage-unavailable guardrail present; browser console had 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Extract monolithic `daily-report/page.tsx` into smaller components.
- More complete Daily Report V2 view-model boundary.
- Improve topic/stage links once verified `stageId` is available in event data.

### Goal 6 — Industry Chain Map UI

**Status:** Partial; first verified vertical slice complete.

**Implemented slice:**
- Topic detail industry chain staged lanes.
- Representative company cards.
- `show all` table fallback via URL state `?stage=...&view=all`.
- Narrative-only/insufficient stage labeling without fake stock bindings.

**Evidence in code/tests:**
- `src/app/topics/[id]/page.tsx`
- `src/lib/industryChainUi.test.ts`

**Checkpoint commit:**
- `3d27cb0 feat: add industry chain map UI slice`

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "Goal 6"` → 149/149 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing after all checkpoint commits.
- `npm run build` → passing after all checkpoint commits.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/topics/ic-design?stage=upstream&view=all` → show-all upstream table, narrative-only labels, and no-fake-company copy present; browser console had 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Additional URL-state filters: directness, confidence, freshness, market lens.
- Component extraction for industry-chain UI.
- Canonical company detail route decision remains unresolved.

### Goal 7 — Company Detail UI

**Status:** Partial; first verified vertical slice complete.

**Implemented slice:**
- Company Detail Human Editorial brief appears before dense tabs.
- Brief separates daily change, long-term role, biggest risk, and watch next.
- Visible Goal 7 section inventory: Overview, Daily AI Analysis, Fundamentals, Technicals, Chip/Ownership, News/Events, Products, Topic Roles, SWOT, Sources.
- Source semantics show `AI-derived`, `checked-in evidence`, and partial/empty guardrails.

**Evidence in code/tests:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/components/company-detail/CompanyDetailTabs.tsx`
- `src/components/company-detail/CompanyEditorialBrief.tsx`
- `src/components/company-detail/CompanySectionInventory.tsx`
- `src/lib/view-models/companyEditorialBrief.ts`
- `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts`

**Checkpoint commit:**
- `d0c5261 feat: add company detail editorial brief`

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "Goal 7"` → 149/149 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing after all checkpoint commits.
- `npm run build` → passing after all checkpoint commits.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` → editorial brief, approved section inventory, and source semantics present; browser console had 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Dedicated Sources/Evidence section or tab with complete module table.
- Integrate Daily Analysis V2 artifact into company detail.
- Break company detail out of the huge `src/app/page.tsx` client component.
- Canonical `/companies/[code]` route still not implemented.
- Existing tabs are not yet fully aligned to the Goal 7 section inventory.

### Goal 8 — Topic AI Analysis UI

**Status:** Not started as a Goal 8 UI slice.

**Potential foundation already exists:**
- `src/lib/topicAnalysisContext.ts`
- `src/lib/topicAnalysisContext.test.ts`
- Topic detail page has value-chain/common-risk sections from earlier goals.

**Remaining:**
- Topic-level AI-assisted editorial panel.
- Daily focus and research direction on topic page.
- Direct/peripheral company role narrative.
- Topic risks and sources surfaced with Human Editorial UI.
- Browser smoke `/topics/ai-server` and one memory topic.

### Goal 9 — Automation integration

**Status:** Not started as Goal 9.

**Remaining:**
- Research signal validation workflow.
- V2 daily refresh sequence integration.
- Dry-run verification for no semantic no-op commits.
- Failure reporting by module status.

## Cross-cutting risks

1. **No prior durable goal ledger.** Before this file, completion state existed mostly in chat summaries, tests, and uncommitted diffs. This ledger is now referenced by both `goal-driven-website-completion.md` and `daily-analysis-v2-implementation-plan.md`.
2. **Checkpointed working tree.** Goal 1–7 implementation changes are now split into atomic commits, but the branch is ahead of `origin/main` until pushed/merged.
3. **Goal numbering mismatch.** `goal-driven-website-completion.md` calls them Goal 5/6/7, while `daily-analysis-v2-implementation-plan.md` still labels related work as Task 5.1/5.2/5.3/5.4. Cross-reference notes were added, but future edits still need to preserve both labels until the plan is renumbered.
4. **Partial goals may look complete.** Each goal-run implements the next smallest vertical slice, not necessarily the entire goal description.
5. **Monolithic pages.** `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/daily-report/page.tsx` remain large, increasing edit risk. The new architecture migration plan is `docs/plans/human-editorial-ui-migration-plan.md`.

## Governance/checkpoint updates

### 2026-06-09 — Goal-status tracking slice

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added this durable goal-status ledger.
- Added the ledger reference and update rule to `docs/plans/goal-driven-website-completion.md`.
- Added Goal 6/7/8/9 cross-reference notes to `docs/plans/daily-analysis-v2-implementation-plan.md`.

**Verification:**
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain

**Remaining:**
- Decide whether to renumber implementation-plan Task 5.x items or keep cross-references only.

### 2026-06-09 — Goal 1–7 checkpoint review slice

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Split accumulated implementation into atomic checkpoint commits:
  - `664cecf docs: add daily intelligence specs and sketches`
  - `aa6b11e feat: add daily analysis v2 contracts`
  - `91ed21a feat: add daily analysis context adapters`
  - `a5ecb94 feat: add daily analysis v2 generator`
  - `eba4a7e feat: add daily focus editorial UI`
  - `3d27cb0 feat: add industry chain map UI slice`
  - `d0c5261 feat: add company detail editorial brief`
- Updated this ledger with checkpoint commits, exact verification commands, browser-smoke URLs, and remaining risks.

**Verification:**
- Focused pre-commit test gates were run for contract/generator/UI checkpoint groups.
- Secret scan and `git diff --cached --check` passed before each feature/UI commit.
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/daily-report` → Daily Focus editorial hero, decision brief, topic/company links, and stage-unavailable guardrail present.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/topics/ic-design?stage=upstream&view=all` → show-all table, narrative-only labels, and no-fake-company copy present.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` → Company Detail editorial brief, approved sections, and source semantics present.
- Browser console after smoke checks → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Branch is ahead of `origin/main` by checkpoint commits; push/merge still required if deployment or remote backup is desired.
- Goal 5/6/7 remain Partial rather than full-goal Done.
- Goal 8 and Goal 9 remain not started.
- Component extraction remains needed for `src/app/page.tsx` and `src/app/daily-report/page.tsx`.

### 2026-06-09 — Human Editorial UI architecture migration plan

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `docs/plans/human-editorial-ui-migration-plan.md`.
- Defined Human Editorial UI Architecture Migration mode as behavior-preserving component/view-model extraction, distinct from feature vertical-slice mode.
- Recorded current monolith sizes:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` — 4,178 lines.
  - `src/app/daily-report/page.tsx` — 1,469 lines.
  - `src/app/topics/[id]/page.tsx` — 294 lines.
- Defined target component boundaries under `src/components/shared/editorial`, `src/components/company-detail`, `src/components/daily-report`, and `src/components/topic-detail`.
- Defined target view-model/formatter boundaries under `src/lib/view-models` and `src/lib/formatters`.
- Defined route strategy: keep `/?company=CODE`, add `/companies/[code]` only after route-agnostic component extraction, verify both before migrating internal links.
- Defined migration phases M1–M6, verification gates, risk register, and acceptance criteria.

**Verification:**
- `npm test` → 149/149 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke not required because this was docs-only planning and no app code changed.

**Remaining:**
- Begin Slice M1.1: extract `CompanyEditorialBrief` from `src/app/page.tsx` into `src/components/company-detail/CompanyEditorialBrief.tsx` without behavior change.
- Keep Goal 5/6/7 marked Partial until their remaining sections and extraction work are complete.

### 2026-06-09 — Slice M1.1 CompanyEditorialBrief extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanyEditorialBrief.tsx`.
- Moved the existing Goal 7 Human Editorial company brief JSX out of `src/app/page.tsx` into the dedicated component.
- Kept `buildCompanyEditorialBrief` and all existing copy, labels, source semantics, approved-section inventory, and `/?company=CODE` route behavior unchanged.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` so the regression test follows the extracted component while still proving the brief renders before `DETAIL_TABS.map`.

- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 component extraction with the next company-detail slice; do not add `/companies/[code]` until the planned route compatibility phase.
- `src/app/page.tsx` remains monolithic even after this first extracted component.

### 2026-06-09 — Slice M1.2 CompanyEditorialBrief view-model extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**

- Kept `CompanyEditorialBrief` as a render-only component receiving prepared view-model props.
- Preserved the existing `/?company=CODE` route behavior; no `/companies/[code]` route or link was added in this slice.
- Preserved Goal 7 copy, approved section labels, source/freshness/status labels, fallback text, and recommendation semantics.
- Added focused view-model tests covering both happy path priority/source semantics and insufficient-data fallback behavior.
- Updated component-boundary regression tests so labels/source semantics are verified across page, component, and view-model files.

**Verification:**

- `npm test` → 152/152 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` → company detail renders the Human Editorial brief with `AI-derived`, `checked-in evidence`, approved sections, and prepared view-model content visible; console check reported 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with source/section inventory and tab shell slices before introducing canonical `/companies/[code]` routing.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns most company-detail rendering and data-loading effects.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

### 2026-06-09 — Slice M1.3 CompanySectionInventory and source rail extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanySectionInventory.tsx` for the Goal 7 approved section inventory and source-semantic rail.

- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with `CompanyDetailTabs` shell before introducing canonical `/companies/[code]` routing.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns most company-detail rendering and data-loading effects.

- Moved the existing tab labels and pill-button styling semantics out of `src/app/page.tsx` without rewriting dense section contents.
- Kept active tab state owned by the existing company detail page (`detailTab` / `setDetailTab`) and passed it into the extracted shell via `activeTab` / `onTabChange` props.
- Preserved the existing `/?company=CODE` route behavior; no `/companies/[code]` route or link was added in this slice.
- Preserved existing tab labels, button active/inactive styling, section content rendering order, Goal 7 Human Editorial brief, approved-section labels, source/freshness/confidence labels, fallback text, and recommendation semantics.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.4 guardrails proving tab labels remain, route behavior is unchanged, the extracted shell does not fetch/import checked-in JSON/build view models, and `CompanyEditorialBrief` / `CompanySectionInventory` remain before dense tab modules.

- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction by moving the overview tab content into a render-only component without changing copy, labels, source semantics, or tab behavior.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns dense company-detail tab contents and data-loading effects.

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanyOverviewTab.tsx` for the overview tab's `財務數據` / `重大資訊` sub-tab shell.
- Removed the inline `OverviewTabContent` function from `src/app/page.tsx` and replaced it with `<CompanyOverviewTab>` receiving prepared render slots for the existing financial overview panels and major-news panel.
- Kept financial panel JSX, major-news fetch behavior, `revenueTab` state ownership, dense tab contents, Goal 7 Human Editorial brief, `CompanySectionInventory`, `CompanyDetailTabs`, and active company route behavior unchanged.
- Preserved `/?company=CODE`; no `/companies/[code]` route or link was added in this slice.
- Preserved overview copy and labels including `財務數據`, `重大資訊`, company info, `最新財務概況`, `股利政策`, `營收分析趨勢`, `獲利能力趨勢`, and `重大訊息公告`.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.5 guardrails proving the overview shell boundary does not fetch, import checked-in JSON, build view models, import app/data modules, or introduce `/companies/[code]`; it also verifies `CompanyEditorialBrief` / `CompanySectionInventory` remain before dense tab modules.

**Verification:**
- `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "Goal 7|company editorial brief|section inventory|company detail tabs|overview tab"` → 154/154 passing under Node test filtering behavior.

- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Route guard search across `src/` found only the pre-existing `/companies/${input.companyCode}` reference in `src/lib/productNavigation.ts`; no new `/companies/[code]` route/link was introduced by this slice.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → company detail renders the Human Editorial brief first, approved source rail, extracted tab shell, overview sub-tabs `財務數據` / `重大資訊`, and existing overview financial modules.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors; only React DevTools/HMR informational messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next dense overview sub-panel or remaining tab content slice; keep behavior-preserving extraction only.

- Removed the inline `CompanyInfoHeader` function from `src/app/page.tsx` and imported/rendered the extracted component with the existing prepared `data` prop.
- Preserved existing company identity copy and labels: `市值`, `產業分類`, `成立年份`, `董事長`, `總部`, `官方網站`, company name/code rendering, market-cap fallback, ROC/CE established-year formatting, headquarters `N/A` fallback, and website display/link behavior.
- Kept `CompanyEditorialBrief`, `CompanySectionInventory`, `CompanyDetailTabs`, `CompanyOverviewTab`, dense overview panels, data loading, recommendation semantics, source/freshness/confidence labels, and `/?company=CODE` route behavior unchanged.
- Preserved `/?company=CODE`; no `/companies/[code]` route or link was added in this slice.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.6 guardrails proving the extracted header does not fetch, import checked-in JSON, build view models, import app/data modules, call API routes, or introduce `/companies/[code]`; it also verifies the Human Editorial brief and section inventory remain before dense modules and the company info header still precedes financial overview cards.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "Goal 7|company editorial brief|section inventory|company detail tabs|overview tab|company info header"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyInfoHeader.tsx` did not exist yet.

- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next dense overview sub-panel; keep behavior-preserving extraction only.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `FinancialOverviewCards`, `DividendPolicyPanel`, `RevenueAnalysisPanel`, `ProfitabilityAnalysisPanel`, and other dense tab contents.

- Preserved existing financial overview copy and labels: `最新財務概況`, `季營收`, `市值`, `本益比`, `股價淨值比`, `毛利率`, `營益率`, `淨利率`, and `EPS`.
- Preserved the existing period-label, YoY fallback, market-cap fallback, valuation suffix, margin calculation, and `/?company=CODE` route behavior.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.7 guardrails proving the extracted component does not fetch, import checked-in JSON, build view models, import app/data modules, call API routes, or introduce `/companies/[code]`; it also verifies the overview order remains `CompanyInfoHeader` → `FinancialOverviewCards` → `DividendPolicyPanel`.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.7"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/FinancialOverviewCards.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.7"` → 156/156 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 156/156 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Route guard search across `src/` found only the pre-existing `/companies/${input.companyCode}` reference in `src/lib/productNavigation.ts`; no new `/companies/[code]` route/link was introduced by this slice.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → company detail renders Human Editorial brief/source rail, tabs, overview sub-tabs, extracted company info header, extracted financial overview cards, and the following dividend/revenue modules.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with `DividendPolicyPanel`; keep behavior-preserving extraction only.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `DividendPolicyPanel`, `RevenueAnalysisPanel`, `ProfitabilityAnalysisPanel`, and other dense tab contents.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

- Added `src/components/company-detail/DividendPolicyPanel.tsx` as a render-only dividend policy component for the overview financial slot.
- Removed the inline `DividendPolicyPanel` function from `src/app/page.tsx` and imported/rendered the extracted component with the existing prepared `data` prop.
- Preserved existing dividend copy and labels: `股利政策`, `配息頻率: 季`, `歷年股利發放`, `最新現金股利`, `所屬年度`, `現金股利`, `股票股利`, `合計股利`, `股利年度`, and `📋 歷年股利資料準備中`.
- Preserved existing dividend-history chart/table behavior, ROC-year display, current-cash fallback, dividend-year fallback, and `/?company=CODE` route behavior.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.8 guardrails proving the extracted component does not fetch, import checked-in JSON, build view models, import app/data modules, call API routes, or introduce `/companies/[code]`; it also verifies the overview order remains `FinancialOverviewCards` → `DividendPolicyPanel` → `RevenueAnalysisPanel`.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.8"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/DividendPolicyPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.8"` → 157/157 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 157/157 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Route guard search across `src/` found only the pre-existing `/companies/${input.companyCode}` reference in `src/lib/productNavigation.ts`; no new `/companies/[code]` route/link was introduced by this slice.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → company detail renders Human Editorial brief/source rail, tabs, overview sub-tabs, extracted company info header, extracted financial overview cards, extracted dividend policy panel, and the following revenue module.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with `RevenueAnalysisPanel`; keep behavior-preserving extraction only.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RevenueAnalysisPanel`, `ProfitabilityAnalysisPanel`, and other dense tab contents.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

### 2026-06-10 — Slice M1.9 RevenueAnalysisPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/RevenueAnalysisPanel.tsx` as a render-only revenue analysis component for the overview financial slot.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.9"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/RevenueAnalysisPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.9"` → 158/158 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 158/158 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Route guard search across `src/` found only the pre-existing `/companies/${input.companyCode}` reference in `src/lib/productNavigation.ts`; no new `/companies/[code]` route/link was introduced by this slice.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → company detail renders Human Editorial brief/source rail, tabs, overview sub-tabs, extracted company info header, extracted financial overview cards, extracted dividend policy panel, extracted revenue analysis panel, and the following profitability module.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with `ProfitabilityAnalysisPanel`; keep behavior-preserving extraction only.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `ProfitabilityAnalysisPanel` and other dense tab contents.

- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.10 guardrails proving the extracted component does not fetch, import checked-in JSON, build view models, import app/data modules, call API routes, or introduce `/companies/[code]`; it also verifies the overview order remains `RevenueAnalysisPanel` → `ProfitabilityAnalysisPanel`.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.10"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/ProfitabilityAnalysisPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.

- `npm test` → 159/159 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Route guard remains unchanged: canonical company detail behavior stays on `/?company=CODE`; `/companies/[code]` remains deferred to M2.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → company detail renders Human Editorial brief/source rail, tabs, overview sub-tabs, extracted company info header, extracted financial overview cards, extracted dividend policy panel, extracted revenue analysis panel, and extracted profitability analysis panel.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next dense tab/content boundary after the overview financial sub-panels; keep behavior-preserving extraction only.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns other dense tab contents and shared helper duplication remains intentionally deferred until a named helper-consolidation slice.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

### 2026-06-10 — Slice M1.11 BatchAnalysisPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/BatchAnalysisPanel.tsx` as a render-only batch-analysis card component shared by the chips and technical tabs.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.11"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/BatchAnalysisPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.11"` → 160/160 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 160/160 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Route guard search across `src/` found only the pre-existing `/companies/${input.companyCode}` reference in `src/lib/productNavigation.ts`; no new `/companies/[code]` route/link was introduced by this slice.

- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with a boundary that can stay behavior-preserving and reviewable; likely next candidates are a render-only `TechnicalNextSessionPanel` or a carefully separated news/major-news split.
- `NewsTabContent` and `DynamicMajorNewsPanel` still own client-side API fetches, so they should not be treated as render-only presentational components unless split into container + render panel in a named slice.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

### 2026-06-10 — Slice M1.12 TechnicalNextSessionPanel extraction

- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.12 guardrails proving the extracted component does not fetch, import checked-in JSON, build view models, import app/data modules, call API routes, or introduce `/companies/[code]`; it also verifies the next-session panel still follows the technical `BatchAnalysisPanel` and precedes the news tab.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.12"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/TechnicalNextSessionPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.

- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next behavior-preserving boundary.
- Avoid treating `NewsTabContent` / `DynamicMajorNewsPanel` as render-only because they own `useState`, `useEffect`, and `/api/*` fetches; split container + presentational panel in a named slice if tackling news next.
- Inspect whether the legacy inline `ProfitabilityTrendPanel` is still referenced before deciding whether to extract, retire, or defer it.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

### 2026-06-10 — Slice M1.13 ChipValuationSnapshotPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/ChipValuationSnapshotPanel.tsx` as a render-only valuation/debt snapshot component for the chips tab.
- Removed the inline chips-tab valuation card and local `StatItem` helper from `src/app/page.tsx`, replacing them with `<ChipValuationSnapshotPanel data={data} />`.
- Preserved existing chips copy and labels: `🎰 籌碼分析`, `本益比 (P/E)`, `股價淨值比 (P/B)`, `現金殖利率`, and `負債比`.
- Preserved existing P/E/P/B suffix behavior, dividend-yield percent display, debt-ratio calculation, chips-tab ordering, and `/?company=CODE` route behavior.

- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with a named container/presentational split for news or another safe render-only boundary.
- Avoid moving `NewsTabContent` / `DynamicMajorNewsPanel` as a single render-only component because they own `useState`, `useEffect`, and `/api/*` fetches.
- Inspect whether the legacy inline `ProfitabilityTrendPanel` is still referenced before deciding whether to extract, retire, or defer it.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.14"` → 163/163 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 163/163 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Route guard across changed files found no `/companies/[code]`, `/companies/${...}`, or new `/companies` href string in this slice.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run start -- --port 3048` → company detail renders Human Editorial brief/source rail, overview `重大資訊` sub-tab, extracted `📋 重大訊息公告`, `資料來源：local snapshot`, fetched-at copy, and snapshot major-news rows.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**

- Inspect whether the legacy inline `ProfitabilityTrendPanel` is still referenced before deciding whether to extract, retire, or defer it.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

### 2026-06-10 — Slice M1.15 RelatedNewsListPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/RelatedNewsListPanel.tsx` as a render-only presentational component for the related-news card/list inside the `相關新聞` tab.

- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → company detail renders Human Editorial brief/source rail, tab shell, and the extracted related-news panel after switching to `相關新聞`, including `搜尋「台積電 2330」近 30 日報導` and current article rows from `/api/news`.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors; only React DevTools informational messages.
- Note: the first smoke attempt used `npm run dev -- --port 3048`; that Turbopack dev session served the static markup but did not hydrate tab/query interactions in the browser tool. Restarting with the production build (`npm run start`) restored the expected `/?company=2330` smoke behavior, matching previous slices' verification pattern.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next safe behavior-preserving boundary; avoid moving fetch/state containers unless the slice explicitly splits container and presentational panel.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `NewsTabContent` as the `/api/news` container and other dense tab contents.
- Inspect whether the legacy inline `ProfitabilityTrendPanel` is still referenced before deciding whether to extract, retire, or defer it.

- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → company detail renders `台積電`, tabs, industry-analysis tab, extracted `產品 / 題材角色 / SWOT 產業知識總覽`, `產品知識`, `題材角色`, `SWOT`, and the following `產業定位總覽` content.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next safe behavior-preserving boundary below the industry knowledge overview, likely the industry role/positioning content or another dense render-only tab block.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, and other company-detail data shaping.

- Preserved existing copy/labels and semantics: `題材角色統整摘要`, `來源整合`, `Daily industry score`, `Evidence-backed coverage`, `證據覆蓋與資料信心水位`, and `資料不足項目只做觀察，不升級成推薦`.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.19 guardrails proving the extracted component is presentational-only: no `useState`, no `useEffect`, no `fetch`, no checked-in JSON import, no view-model building, no product-knowledge lookup, no app/data imports, no API route calls, and no `/companies/[code]` route/link introduction.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.19"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyIndustryRoleSummaryPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.19|M1.18"` → 168/168 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 168/168 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → after switching to `產業分析`, company detail renders industry knowledge overview, extracted `產業定位總覽`, extracted `題材角色統整摘要`, evidence coverage heading, observation-only warning, and following `🎯 市場定位` in the expected order.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next safe behavior-preserving boundary inside selected industry detail; likely `CompanyIndustryMarketPositionPanel` for `🎯 市場定位` and maybe the daily-industry signal/risk/watch detail only if it stays render-only.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, product/customer/SWOT rendering, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

- `npm test` → 169/169 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → after switching to `產業分析`, company detail renders extracted `題材角色統整摘要`, evidence coverage heading, observation-only warning, extracted `市場定位`, and following `技術重心` in the expected order.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next safe behavior-preserving boundary inside selected industry detail; likely the `🔬 技術重心` card and its daily-industry signal/risk/watch subgrid, while keeping `dailyIndustryApplies`, `dailyIndustry`, `topicAnalysis.focus`, and all matching/data assembly in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, product/customer/SWOT rendering, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.

- `npm test` → 170/170 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `npm run start -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3048` → after switching to `產業分析`, company detail renders extracted `題材角色統整摘要`, evidence coverage heading, extracted `市場定位`, extracted `技術重心`, and following `主要產品` in the expected order. On the default 2330 selected topic, the daily-industry signal/risk/watch labels are absent because no matching daily-industry rows apply; source guardrails still lock the render-only subgrid in the component.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next safe behavior-preserving boundary inside selected industry detail; likely `CompanyIndustryProductsPanel` for `📦 主要產品`, while keeping `topicProducts`, `findProductKnowledgeItem(...)`, `productKnowledgeToNarrative(...)`, `describeProduct(...)`, product evidence matching, and all data assembly in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, product/customer/SWOT rendering, and other company-detail data shaping.

- Replaced the inline margin chart/table JSX in `src/app/page.tsx` with `<CompanyMarginTradingPanel chartData={marginChartData} rows={marginRows} shortMarginRatio={ratio} />`.
- Kept margin data ownership and shaping in `src/app/page.tsx`: `data.margin_history`, recent-window slicing, latest `ratio`, `marginChartData`, and `marginRows` remain in the page container.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.29 guardrails proving the component has no fetch/effect/data imports/API routes/future `/companies/[code]` route and that margin panel order remains after institutional trend and before PER/PBR valuation trend.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.29"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyMarginTradingPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.29|M1.28|M1.27"` → 178/178 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 178/178 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `PORT=3048 npm run start` → after switching to `籌碼分析`, company detail renders `🎰 籌碼分析`, `📊 三大法人買賣超趨勢（近30日）`, `💰 融資融券`, `券資比：`, margin table labels (`日期`, `融資餘額`, `融券餘額`, `券資比`, `融資買`, `融資賣`), and `📐 本益比 / 淨值比 / 殖利率趨勢`.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue M1 company-detail extraction with the next safe dense chips panel, likely `CompanyValuationTrendPanel`, while keeping `data.per_history`, recent-window slicing, chart-data mapping, and table-row shaping in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, remaining PER/PBR chart-table data shaping, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.


### 2026-06-11 — Slice M1.30 CompanyValuationTrendPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanyValuationTrendPanel.tsx` as a render-only panel for the `📐 本益比 / 淨值比 / 殖利率趨勢` chart/table inside the company-detail `籌碼分析` tab.
- Replaced the inline PER/PBR/yield chart/table JSX in `src/app/page.tsx` with `<CompanyValuationTrendPanel chartData={valuationChartData} rows={valuationRows} />`.
- Kept valuation data ownership and shaping in `src/app/page.tsx`: `data.per_history`, recent-window slicing, `valuationChartData`, and `valuationRows` remain in the page container.
- Removed the route-local `darkTooltipProps` constant after extracting the final chips-tab panel that used it; the new component owns only static presentational tooltip styling.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.30 guardrails proving the component has no fetch/effect/data imports/API routes/future `/companies/[code]` route, that PER history shaping remains in the page, and that valuation trend stays after margin trading within `CompanyChipsTabShell`.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.30"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyValuationTrendPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.30|M1.29|M1.28"` → 179/179 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 179/179 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `PORT=3048 npm run start` → after switching to `籌碼分析`, company detail renders `📊 三大法人買賣超趨勢（近30日）`, `💰 融資融券`, `📐 本益比 / 淨值比 / 殖利率趨勢`, and valuation table/chart labels (`日期`, `本益比`, `淨值比`, `殖利率%`).
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Chips-tab dense panel extraction is complete for the three chart/table panels: `CompanyInstitutionalTrendPanel`, `CompanyMarginTradingPanel`, and `CompanyValuationTrendPanel`.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, technical tab chart shaping, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.


### 2026-06-11 — Slice M1.31 CompanyTechnicalTrendPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanyTechnicalTrendPanel.tsx` as a render-only panel wrapper for the `📈 技術走勢圖` card inside the company-detail `技術分析` tab.
- Replaced the inline technical trend card JSX in `src/app/page.tsx` with `<CompanyTechnicalTrendPanel ... />`, passing prepared chart content, scope controls, MA toggle controls, chart mode, and latest K-line date.
- Kept technical data ownership and shaping in `src/app/page.tsx`: `trends?.daily_prices`, `trends.monthly_price`, scope date filtering, `computeMA`, `candleData`, `volumeData`, MA-line arrays, `techScope`, and `maLines` state remain in the page container.
- The new component owns only presentational card chrome, TradingView outbound link, scope/MA button rendering, official FinMind K-line source copy, monthly fallback copy, and empty-state copy. It does not import app/data modules or `TradingViewChart`/`PriceAreaChart`.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.31 guardrails proving the component has no fetch/effect/data imports/API routes/future `/companies/[code]` route, that K-line shaping and tech state remain in the page, and that technical indicators still follow the technical trend panel.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.31"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyTechnicalTrendPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.31|M1.30|M1.12"` → 180/180 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 180/180 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `PORT=3048 npm run start` → after switching to `技術分析`, company detail renders `📈 技術走勢圖`, scope buttons (`1M`, `3M`, `6M`, `YTD`, `1Y`, `5Y`), MA toggles (`MA5`, `MA10`, `MA20`, `MA60`), official source copy (`K 線最新日期`, `Source: FinMind TaiwanStockPrice checked-in OHLCV`, `只更新官方/FinMind 日 K，不用 AI 補 K 線`), `📈 技術指標數值`, and `📊 技術分析判讀`.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue technical-tab extraction with the next safe panel, likely `CompanyTechnicalIndicatorsPanel`, while keeping `computeTechnicalSummary(trends?.daily_prices)`, numeric formatting, and `indicatorCards` shaping in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, technical indicator shaping, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.


### 2026-06-11 — Slice M1.32 CompanyTechnicalIndicatorsPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanyTechnicalIndicatorsPanel.tsx` as a render-only panel for the `📈 技術指標數值` grid inside the company-detail `技術分析` tab.
- Replaced the inline technical-indicator card grid in `src/app/page.tsx` with `<CompanyTechnicalIndicatorsPanel cards={indicatorCards} />`.
- Kept technical summary ownership and shaping in `src/app/page.tsx`: `computeTechnicalSummary(trends?.daily_prices)`, `fmtNum`, `indicatorCards`, trend/MA/volume/valuation display text, and color-class decisions remain in the page container.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.32 guardrails proving the component has no fetch/effect/data imports/API routes/future `/companies/[code]` route, that technical summary shaping remains in the page, and that technical analysis/next-session panels still follow the indicators panel.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.32"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyTechnicalIndicatorsPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.32|M1.31|M1.12"` → 181/181 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 181/181 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `PORT=3048 npm run start` → after switching to `技術分析`, company detail renders `📈 技術指標數值`, all indicator labels (`趨勢判讀`, `最新收盤`, `MA5 / MA10`, `MA20 / MA60`, `成交量`, `量比`, `20日高 / 低`, `估值`), `📊 技術分析判讀`, and `🎯 明日觀察與盤中觸發條件`.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue technical-tab extraction with the next safe panel boundary, likely a dedicated wrapper for the technical analysis batch block if it can stay render-only without moving `resolvedDailyAnalysis` ownership.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, `resolvedDailyAnalysis` wiring, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.


### 2026-06-11 — Slice M1.33 CompanyTechnicalAnalysisPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanyTechnicalAnalysisPanel.tsx` as a render-only wrapper for the `📊 技術分析判讀` `BatchAnalysisPanel` usage inside the company-detail `技術分析` tab.
- Replaced the direct technical-tab `<BatchAnalysisPanel title="📊 技術分析判讀" ... />` call in `src/app/page.tsx` with `<CompanyTechnicalAnalysisPanel ... />`.
- Kept Daily Analysis ownership and date/source fallback selection in `src/app/page.tsx`: `resolvedDailyAnalysis`, `resolvedDailyAnalysis.technical.*`, `resolvedDailyAnalysis.generatedAt`, `latestKLineDate ?? resolvedDailyAnalysis.marketDataDate ?? resolvedDailyAnalysis.sourceUpdatedAt ?? "未知"`, tab state, and all analysis wiring remain in the page container.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.33 guardrails proving the wrapper has no fetch/effect/data imports/API routes/future `/companies/[code]` route, that Daily Analysis data/date ownership remains in the page, and that technical analysis still appears after indicators and before next-session triggers.
- Repaired adjacent source guardrails for M1.11, M1.12, and M1.32 so they track the new wrapper boundary instead of the intentionally removed direct `BatchAnalysisPanel` usage in `page.tsx`.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.33"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyTechnicalAnalysisPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.33|M1.32|M1.12|M1.11"` → 182/182 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 182/182 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `PORT=3048 npm run start` → after switching to `技術分析`, company detail renders `📊 技術分析判讀`, the exact description `依日 K、均線與成交量規則判讀 · 價格資料日 2026-06-11`, `正向訊號`, `風險訊號`, `觀察重點`, and `🎯 明日觀察與盤中觸發條件`; order remained indicators → technical analysis → next-session triggers.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue technical-tab extraction with the final visible next-session panel wrapper already extracted in M1.12; the next practical slice is likely moving remaining `技術分析` tab render orchestration into a technical-tab shell only if it can stay render-only without moving `techScope`, `maLines`, K-line shaping, `indicatorCards`, or `resolvedDailyAnalysis` ownership.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, `resolvedDailyAnalysis` wiring, technical chart/indicator shaping, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.


### 2026-06-11 — Slice M1.34 CompanyResearchChartsPlaceholderPanel extraction

**Status:** Done.

**Changed:**
- Added `src/components/company-detail/CompanyResearchChartsPlaceholderPanel.tsx` as a render-only static placeholder for the company-detail `研究圖表` tab.
- Replaced the inline placeholder card in `src/app/page.tsx` with `<CompanyResearchChartsPlaceholderPanel />`.
- Kept tab and routing ownership in `src/app/page.tsx`: `detailTab`, `setDetailTab`, `CompanyDetailTabs`, URL query behavior, and all company-detail data ownership remain in the page container.
- Updated `src/lib/companyDetailUi.test.ts` with Slice M1.34 guardrails proving the placeholder has no state/effects/fetch/data imports/API routes/future `/companies/[code]` route, that charts-tab state remains in the page, and that the placeholder remains inside the `charts` tab branch.

**Verification:**
- Initial focused RED check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.34"` failed because `src/components/company-detail/CompanyResearchChartsPlaceholderPanel.tsx` did not exist yet.
- Focused post-extraction check: `npm test -- --test-name-pattern "M1.34|M1.33"` → 183/183 passing under Node test filtering behavior.
- `npm test` → 183/183 passing.
- `npm run build` → passing; pre-existing Next.js workspace-root and edge-runtime warnings remain.
- Browser smoke `http://127.0.0.1:3048/?company=2330` with `PORT=3048 npm run start` → after switching to `研究圖表`, company detail renders `研究圖表`, `功能規劃中，敬請期待`, and `將提供更多進階分析圖表與研究工具`.
- Browser console after smoke check → 0 JS errors/messages.

**Remaining:**
- Continue shrinking `src/app/page.tsx` by extracting the next safe visible boundary. Since current `financial` and `announcements` tab buttons do not yet have dedicated content branches, the next practical slices are likely remaining dense helpers/render blocks elsewhere in the company detail page, or a shell extraction only if it can stay behavior-preserving without moving tab state/data ownership.
- `src/app/page.tsx` still owns `RealtimeQuote`, `NewsTabContent`, tab state, URL query behavior, `buildCompanyIndustryInsights()` invocation, selected industry-role detail shaping, `resolvedDailyAnalysis` wiring, technical chart/indicator shaping, and other company-detail data shaping.
- Existing `/companies` overview route remains, but canonical `/companies/[code]` is intentionally deferred to M2.



## Recommended operating rule from now on

After each goal-run:

1. Update this ledger.
2. Include exact verification commands and browser smoke URL.
3. Mark whether the goal is Done or Partial.
4. Record remaining risks and the next smallest suggested slice.
5. Prefer committing a checkpoint after tests/build/browser smoke pass.
